Core elements for kurento media server

The kms-core project contains core elements needed for the Kurento Media Server.

How to generate the clients
---------------------------

The clients code needs to be generated from the destination folder:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
```

After that, by just invoking ```cmake``` from this folder will generate the
client both for Java and Javascript

```bash
cmake .. -DGENERATE_JS_CLIENT_PROJECT=TRUE -DGENERATE_JAVA_CLIENT_PROJECT=TRUE -DDISABLE_LIBRARIES_GENERATION=TRUE
```

If you want to generate just one of the clients, you need to set it on the
command line. For Javascript it is:

```bash
rm -rf js
cmake .. -DGENERATE_JS_CLIENT_PROJECT=TRUE -DDISABLE_LIBRARIES_GENERATION=TRUE
```

and for Java it is:

```bash
rm -rf java
cmake .. -DGENERATE_JAVA_CLIENT_PROJECT=TRUE -DDISABLE_LIBRARIES_GENERATION=TRUE
```
